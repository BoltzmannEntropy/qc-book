# WORK IN PROGRESS: 

EXPECTED PUBLICATION DATE **SEPTEMBER, 2022**. 

We are well aware of the magnificent books and courses available on quantum computing. Nonetheless, we believe that a set of **mock exams** for senior physics students is still lacking. We assume that our readers have a thorough foundation in physics, notably quantum mechanics, as well as a working knowledge of quantum information processing. We made no attempt to self-contain our book by explaining every concept that is required on an ad hoc basis. However, we trust that we have communicated the fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics and computer science that support the book.

Building a quantum computer requires **multidisciplinary knowledge** involving experimental and theoretical physics, photonics, computer science, software engineering, and of course quantum mechanics. **If you are considering graduate school in QC**, you should start by reading: *"Preparing for the quantum revolution: What is the role of higher education"*

**If you are a attending graduate school in quantum computing, this book is for you.** 
The topics include:
- **Quantum information processing**
- **Quantum computing**
- **Quantum information theory**
