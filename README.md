EXPECTED PUBLICATION DATE **OCTOBER, 2022**. 

When we begin studying quantum computing (QC), we enter a magnificent world overflowing with enlightening revelations. We are tempted to use magical or even
miraculous terms to characterise our initial encounter with the **Dirac** notation; and as we continue to study the subject, we are continually astounded by the elegance
and breadth of the results, as demonstrated by the usage of the quantum Fourier transform. However, building a quantum computer requires knowledge in a combination
of experimental and theoretical physics, photonics, computer science, software engineering, and of course, quantum mechanics.

**But how does one gain such a knowledge?**. To address the anticipated future demand for highly qualified experts in quantum science and technology, dozens of colleges worldwide have established **graduate programmes in QC** that may appeal to students studying physics as well as computer science. These study programmes extend
far beyond the normal quantum physics curriculum, in part because notions of quantum information processing, quantum algorithms, and Python circuit programming
are also emphasised. 

If you are considering graduate school in QC, I suggest you begin your journey by reading: _"Preparing for the quantum revolution: What role does higher education
play?"_. On the other hand, this book is for you if you are currently enrolled in a graduate programme in QC.

We are well aware of the great books and courses on QC that are accessible, but nonetheless, we believe that a collection of **practice exams** for seniors in physics
is still missing. We presume that our readers have a firm grasp of fundamental physics, particularly quantum mechanics, as well as some familiarity with quantum
information processing. We made no attempt to self-contain our book by describing each subject as needed. 

The primary target consists of graduate students in physics and computer science who are interested in practising problems before their graduate exams. Linear algebra
and matrices are foundational concepts in both physics and computer science, and this book presupposes familiarity with the Dirac notation and linear algebra manipulations that are critical in quantum information processing.

Although I have not abandoned my prior research interests (AI), they have steadily gravitated towards the field of quantum computing and I am presently pursuing a career in quantum information processing. Even with significant roadblocks on the way to a working quantum computer, scientists are making steady progress, but it is still impossible to predict when we will have thousands of qubits on a quantum computer. Until recently, very few scientists, let alone engineers, were trained and equipped to use quantum hardware and software. This profession requires practitioners to understand fundamental ideas from mathematics, quantum physics, and computer science and combine these in novel and creative ways.
